We are getting ready for the start of our ride down the Florida coast from Fernandina Beach to Key West, then by ferry to Marco Island and across the Everglades to Ft. Lauderdale.  Taking it easy--averaging 40 miles a day. No massive expedition like our ride across American in 2017 (see "More Trips" in the menu above). Instead, we're traveling ultra-light and popping into beach hotels each night. This is the life--it had better be!

That's the 7 mile bridge above.  Somehow we are riding across it. We'll figure it out when we get there.

Why? Because.

No, why?

Well... ...I use this great app called FulGaz (feel the burn?) to ride around the world with high quality videos and the real terrain of the ride simulated by a Tacx Neo smart trainer. The company is located in Australia, though they have rides from around the world. The GPS trail of the virtual ride shows up in my ride history, like I really did it (I really did, didn't I?). So, you see that I have ridden the Adelaide Gorge many times.  It is really beautiful.  I thought let's do it _really_. Unfortunately, some logistical reality became real and we had to choose a warm US ride instead.

This is it!
