Day 4 as uneventful but long: 51.4 miles.  We arrived in Titusville, whose primary claim to fame is the jumping off point for visitors to the Kennedy Space Center on Cape Canaveral.

We didn’t schedule time to visit—this time.  But, if Emmy doesn’t get over her pining for space men, there will be a next time.  (I am very fortunate this fellow could not ever get out of his space suit.)
