On our ride to Little Torch Key, we rode the legendary 7 Mile Bridge as seen in the 7 Mile Selfie, above. The shoulder is wide; the sun is hot; the water is turquoise; no flat tires; we lived to tell.

It is a strange thing. Under much of the bridge, the water appears to be no more than a few feet deep. On the shorter bridges between keys, people fish. Where the gap between keys is really short, it seems that muck was dredged from the shallow sea to create man-made causeways to link successive keys. While this is the longest bridge connecting Florida keys, it is not even _close_ to the longest bridge in the world, which is the Danyang-Kushan Grand Bridge in China at 102 miles for a high speed railway.
