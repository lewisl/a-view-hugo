We arrived in Nokomis, Florida to pick up our RV: a Leisure Travel Serenity. This is the start of a new, very American adventure. We will travel 3700 miles.

Along the way, we will pick up a new wire-haired dachshund puppy in Pearl, Mississippi. He or she will accompany us the rest of the way to his or her new home in the Pacific Northwest. Will he or she lose his or her barking accent?
