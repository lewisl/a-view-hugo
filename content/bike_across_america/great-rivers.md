We have had a chance to see many major rivers and ride along most of them.

Here are some mighty rivers in no particular order except my misty recollections: Skykomish, Wenatchee, Okanagan, Columbia, Kootenai, McDonald, Yellowstone, Mississippi, St. Croix.

And the not so mighty:  Milk, Rum.

It is an impressive thing to see parts of these rivers in their free-running state.  It is less stirring, but still something to contemplate, to see the the vast expanse of the reservoirs behind the dams of others of them.

We were only 70 or so miles south of the source of the Mississippi and though it doesnâ€™t attain its vast expanse until much farther downstream, it is clear that it is the mother river of North America.
