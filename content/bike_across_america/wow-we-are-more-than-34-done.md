Just a quick update since last we spoke.

Yes, we are more than 3/4’s done: 3165 miles from Seattle and only 797 miles to go. Kind of amazing.

After the U.P.M, we rode down the Lake Huron shore of Michigan.

Then we cut across southeastern Michigan to enter Canada in Sombra, Ontario.

From there we rode along the Canadian shores of Lake Erie. At first, it was mostly a long straight road through farm fields. About half-way the road went right to the lake’s edge where we rode past farms on the left and the beach houses of the “chill” people on the right.

This lead us to Niagara Falls where we dined watching the mist rise from the both the American falls and the Canadian horseshoe falls.

Tomorrow, we cross back into the US of A to ride along the Erie Canal.
