We’ve been traveling through Texas for the last two days. My friend who grew up here told me to be on the look out for big hair and armadillos. We are proud to say we have seen both. Everything is big in this state including the Texas shaped waffle Lewis had for breakfast this morning. Oil rigs, truckers, cowboy hats… …it’s all here.
