It always pays to eat local and eat the local catch.  In Florida, the local catch includes grouper, wahoo, and shrimp.  You can have them all fried, grilled, or blackened.  You can have them presented in salads, sandwiches, tacos, and platters. Emmy’s favorite is blackened en taco.  Lewis’ favorite is grilled sandwich or blackened platter.
