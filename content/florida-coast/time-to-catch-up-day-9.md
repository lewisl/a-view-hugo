So much has happened.  An update is way overdue.

Now we are catching up with a barrage, yesâ€”I say a veritable barrage of posts.  See all the posts below for all of the updates.

Uneventful [day 4](/florida_coast/day-four) with an entrancing photo.

Uneventful [day 5](/florida_coast/day-five) with (in)action shots.

Emmy re-unites with [Genie](/florida_coast/re-union-with-genie) (Eugenia) and serious dowsing.  Having fun while drenched.

We are (not) [Navy Seals](/florida_coast/not-navy-seals)

[Cousins](/florida_coast/cousins) and serious dowsing. Quick, where is the Ark?  Never mind; we have water bikes!

[Eat the local catch](/florida_coast//eat-the-local-catch). Eat local and not fancy.

Getting around Mar-a-Lago and serious dowsing.  The President is arriving to watch the Super Bowl.  The middle of the island is blocked.  Only way to get from one end to the other is to cross the intracoastal twice in driving rain and cross-winds.  Fun!
