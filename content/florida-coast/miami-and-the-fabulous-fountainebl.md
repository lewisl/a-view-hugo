Wow, the sun does shine in Florida. We finally got the sunny, warm riding day we'd always dreamed of. With the wind at our backs we flew into Miami, through Hollywood Beach, Fort Lauderdale, and onto Collins Avenue. On Collins Avenue shoreside nature gives way to 6 lanes of traffic jams, skyscraper condos, and fancy-brands shopping--ah, paradise (lost).

Here we are at the faaaabulous Fountainebleau with all of the beautiful people. We watched the Superbowl. We dined. Red meat. And it was faaaabulous. And in the morning we rode to the other end of Miami-Dade County, in more ways than one. On to Homestead.
