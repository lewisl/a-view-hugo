Welcome to Adventure Cycling's New England Streams and Villages, a 314 mile ramble through rural New England. This is what Adventure Cycling calls an "inn to inn" ride, which is their most luxurious category. Still, we carry all of our own equipment and clothing and there is no sag wagon. The good news is that we stay at inns and enjoy the local cuisine for breakfast and dinner. We have a guide and gps routes.

Here is our itinerary:


-  Day 1 - Saturday, June 22, Northampton, MA - 0 miles, meet and greet

-  Day 2 - Sunday, June 23, Brattleboro, VT - 47 miles - 1243 feet

-  Day 3 - Monday, June 24, Londonderry, VT - 47 miles - 3135 feet

-  Day 4 - Tuesday, June 25, Bennington, VT - 43 miles - 2635 feet

-  Day 5 & 6 - Wednesday-Thursday, June 26-27, Stockbridge, MA - 54 miles - 3110 feet
    Day 6 excursion around Stockbridge - 30 miles - 2069 feet

-  Day 7 - Friday, June 28, Avon, CT - 52 miles - 2281 feet

-  Day 8 - Saturday, June 29, Northampton, MA - 42 miles - 1186 feet

I've included each day's elevation gain so that you can see, dear reader, that this is no "cakeride."
