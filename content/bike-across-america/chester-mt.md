If ever you are in Chester, Montana for any reason at all, you must stay at the The Westland Suite. This old bank building has been converted into a wonderfully comfortable b&b. We had a found a second home for Christopher to cook a great meal, to wash away the dust of the road, and catch up on laundry. They even provide a large jar of ear plugs so that you can sleep while 10 or more trains pass by in the night not more than 200 feet away.  (I have no recollection of *any* trains passing in the night, but I am told by others there were some.)

There is also an excellent and well-stocked hardware store right next store and a charming and helpful pharmacy right around the block.

Even for just an afternoon and night we enjoyed a restful stop.
