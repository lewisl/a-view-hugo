Everyone’s been on the ride–simply everyone.

Jay, Ellie, and Susie have all joined, each for 3 different days of riding. What a delight. All 3 have done stints on our e-bike, declaring they wished they’d ridden the real bike. Actually, Jay was rather smitten with the e-bike...   ...truth be known.
