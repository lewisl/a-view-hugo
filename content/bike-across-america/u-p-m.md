That’s Upper Peninsula of Michigan for people in the know. It’s the scimitar shaped sliver of Michigan attached to Wisconsin, which touches Lakes Superior, Michigan, and Huron.

We’ve been to Iron Mountain, Escanaba, and Manistique. Next we’ll go to Trout Lake and St. Ignace–jumping off point to Mackinac Island and “lower” Michigan.
