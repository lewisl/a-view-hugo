On August 18 we rode into Great Cranberry Island after a short boat ride from Southwest Harbor, Maine. It was raining and a bit chilly wearing only the “maillot jaune” (and shoes and shorts!). 

Fabulous ride. Great support from Emmy, Ellie, Jay, Susie and the team of Andrew and Christopher. Great to have James Dailey, and Jeff and Tricia Raikes join the ride.

3950 miles total. 68 days of riding. 75 days on the road. Average daily distance: 58 miles. Average speed while moving: 12.2 mph. Cumulative elevation gain: 141,314 feet. Calories burned: lots. Calories of root beer floats, soft serve ice cream, pancake/eggs/bacon breakfast acquired: not quite as many.
