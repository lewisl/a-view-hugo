Three stalwart cyclists and the valiant support crew set off to Skykomish.  From the shores of Lake Washington in Seattle we are heading to the Atlantic coast at Great Cranberry Island, Maine.  All because in May of 2016 I thought I should ride across the US for my 60th birthday.  I began researching and planning.

Somehow, I convinced Emmy to go with me. We bought an RV to use as the support vehicle, mini-cabin, and--little did we know--cross-the-country food truck.  We drove that sucker from Florida to Seattle in December 2016.

Then on May 28, 2017 we set off. 3 cyclists, 2 vehicles, 2 dogs, 2 drivers, and Emmy--wondering what she'd signed up for.
