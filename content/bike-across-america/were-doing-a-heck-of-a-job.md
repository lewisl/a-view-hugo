We’ve completed 2446 miles out of a projected 3936 miles or 62% of the trip. I’ve laid out the bare facts. It’s time in the next posts for a lot more photos and for some impressions, happenings, and anecdotes.

It’s hard to keep up with the blog. I’m up by 6:30 and usually riding by 7:30 AM. I’m on the road about 6 to 7 hours including lunch and stops for a typical day. Then, we clean up, get ready for dinner, do chores like replotting routes, paying bills from home, changing reservations. And then to bed by 9:30.

Now that riding is getting easier, there is more time for recreation. And blogs and photos.
