After a day in touristy SandPoint, ID–where we enjoyed amazing coffee (current record-holder for best morning coffee on the bike trek) and pastries at Pine Street Coffee–we continued into Montana where we will spend 15 days!

So far, here’s where we’ve been:

- the charming Amber Bear Inn in Heron;
- then after a stop at Kootenai Falls we were on to Libby;
- then to Rexford Bench on the shores of the Reservoir called Lake Koocanusa;
- on to the resort town of Whitefish;
- two days in the gem of Glacier National Park;
- the plains began at Cut Bank;
- coasted on to Chester.

And here are the all-consuming stats:

Four more towns have passed under our wheels:
