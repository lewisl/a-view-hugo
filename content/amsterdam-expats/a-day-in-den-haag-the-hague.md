With our daughter Susie, who is visiting for a week, we took a 50 minute train ride from Amsterdam to Den Haag. We visited three spots:

1. **The Gemeente Museum** (Obama had been there the day before talking about the Nuclear Safety Issues!) Due to the renovations of the more popular Mauritshaus Museum, the Gemeente had received 100 of this museum’s famous paintings. Two of our favorites…

    a. Rembrandt van Rijn – *The anatomy lesson of Dr Nicolaes Tulp*

    b. Johannes Vermeer – *View of Delft*

2. **Madurodam** A huge miniature village which reminded us of legoland except the materials were realistic. A whole outside area was dedicated to Holland’s buildings, streets, canals, you name it… even Schipohl Airport in miniature.  Here Susie-the-giant towers over a lilliputian Rijksmuseume.

3. **Escher in Het Paleis** A museum which houses two floors of M.C. Escher’s works in Queen Emma's of the Netherlands former winter palace.
